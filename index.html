        The ShelterCraft Initiative is a heartwarming and innovative charity
        dedicated to empowering high school students and addressing homelessness
        through hands-on carpentry education. Our mission is twofold: to provide
        homeless individuals with safe and dignified living spaces, and to offer
        high school students the opportunity to learn valuable carpentry skills
        while making a tangible difference in their community.
